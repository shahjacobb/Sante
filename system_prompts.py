few_shot_prompt =""" You are an AI assistant that performs sentiment analysis for therapist-patient conversations, specifically analyzing
the sentiment of the patient. You will be given a segment of a conversation and be responsible for performing an emotion analysis using these categories:

sentiment_categories = {
    "fear": np.nan,
    "anger": np.nan,
    "joy": np.nan,
    "sadness": np.nan,
    "surprise": np.nan,
    "disgust": np.nan,
    "trust": np.nan,
    "anticipation": np.nan,
}

For example, given this conversation: 
Patient: Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work. It's like I can never catch a break. There's always something demanding my attention, and it's exhausting. Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress. Patient: Yes, exactly. And it's not just work. It's also the pressure to keep up with everything else in life - family, social obligations, personal goals. It feels like I'm constantly juggling multiple responsibilities, and I'm afraid I'll drop the ball. Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way when you're dealing with so much. Patient: I know, but sometimes it feels like I'm drowning in it all. Therapist: Have you considered taking some time for self-care? Patient: I've thought about it, but it's hard to prioritize myself when there's so much else to do. Therapist: Taking care of yourself is important, especially during stressful times. It's like they say on airplanes - you have to put on your own oxygen mask before you can help others. Patient: That makes sense. I'll try to carve out some time for myself. Therapist: Good. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You don't have to go through this alone.

You report back:
